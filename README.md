# 🛡️ Analyze Network Attacks – SYN Flood Case Study

This project documents a real-world analysis of a simulated network attack affecting a company's web server. The investigation reveals a **SYN flood DoS attack** that disrupted normal employee access to the company's web service.

## 📂 Files Included

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Cybersecurity_Incident_Report_Rehan.docx** | Final report documenting the entire investigation. It explains the attack, its impact, and suggests mitigation steps. |
| **Wireshark TCP_HTTP log.xlsx** | Raw log of TCP/HTTP traffic captured during the attack. Includes packet timestamps, source/destination, and protocol info. Highlights attacker and normal traffic. |
| **How to read a Wireshark TCP_HTTP log.odt** | A guide to understanding the structure and meaning of Wireshark logs. Used as reference to decode patterns in this project. |

## 📝 Summary

### 🔍 Scenario
As a Security Analyst at a travel agency, I was alerted to a service interruption. Upon inspection, I discovered that a **malicious IP was sending repeated TCP SYN requests**, overwhelming the server’s capacity and preventing employees from accessing critical web content.

### 🛠 Tools Used
- **Wireshark**
- **TCP/HTTP Protocol Analysis**
- **Firewall Rule Configuration**
- **Incident Response Documentation**

## ✅ What I Did
- Captured and analyzed network logs using Wireshark
- Identified attacker behavior through SYN packet patterns
- Differentiated between legitimate and malicious traffic
- Drafted a professional **incident report** for internal escalation
